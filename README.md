This is a learning project for me to get familiar with the tooling and workflow of building a Haskell application.
I'm adapting the scripts from Graham Hutton's YouTube course, 
[Advanced Functional Programming in Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF1Z-APd9zK5uFc8FKr_di9bfsYv8-lbc), to learn to use the GHC, VSCode, and Github to build an app.
